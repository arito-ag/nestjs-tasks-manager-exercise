## Description

This is an example of a REST API created with  [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript and [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), using a MySQL database.

It is a Task Manager where Users register and using the token provided at Login, they can only Consult, Create, Update, and Delete their tasks. Additionally, the actions they perform with their Tasks are stored in the database to keep track of possible errors.

## How to use

1.  Register in DB with endpoint User Register: `/api/v1/auth/register` providing *username* and *password*.
2. Login with *username* and *password* to get ***token***
3. Use that token in the **tasks** endpoints.

Note: Keep in mind that to use the **Create** endpoint of a ***Task***, it is necessary to use *Multipart Form* (in the client testing the app) to ensure the file upload to the AWS S3 bucket.
